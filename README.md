This is a custom 4 port USB hub meant to be installed inside the Original Xbox along with an OGX360. The Xbox motherboard plugs into an internally installed OGX360 via 2 Xbox motherbaord to USB Micro B x2 cables, the OGX360 plugs into the hub via a USB A to 4 pin connenctor, then the controller ports are plugged into the hub. This allows your controller ports to support any device the OGX360 supports with the use of an Xbox to USB adapter.
